## Buy several tickets

Snowcamp doesn't propose to buy several tickets in once time.
It is our policy from the creation of the event.
To buy several tickets, you can only buy each ticket one by one.

## Ticket sharing

The ticket for a single seat obtained during registration allows you to receive a badge on Thursday morning during the welcome session.
Each ticket is personalized and typically cannot be transferred.
However, we tolerate companies sharing badges among their employees over the 2 days.
Thus, for each ticket/seat, it is possible for you to send one person on Thursday and another on Friday.
The badge will be necessary for entry on Friday morning.
The transfer of the badge between the person on Thursday and the one on Friday must be managed on your end.
We do not distribute two badges for a single ticket.
Upon arrival on Friday, the person can affix a label to put their name on the badge.
Please note that the meal preference (regular or vegetarian) will be the one indicated in the Billetweb platform by December 31st.
Beyond this date, we proceed with the order from our caterer (and the printing of badges).
Therefore, ensure that the choice is compatible with the preferences of both individuals sharing the badge.

## Ticket Transfer

Tickets are personalized but can be transferred to someone else in exceptional circumstances. Bulk purchase of tickets for resale is strictly prohibited.

The exchange of money during a ticket transfer is not managed by the Snowcamp organization. This transaction must be carried out between the transferor and the acquirer.

With regard to the Snowcamp organization, it is necessary that the conference participant wears a badge with their name.
Two cases are possible:

- If the ticket transfer takes place **before** December 31st, then the transferor must update the participant's information in Billetweb using the link received in the email containing the ticket.
- If the ticket transfer takes place **after** December 31st, then the acquirer must present themselves on the day at the Snowcamp reception with the transferor's name and go to the line corresponding to the letter of the transferor's name. They will be given the badge that will be in the transferor's name (as the badges will have already been sent for printing). The acquirer will have labels available to stick over the transferor's name and must put their real first name/last name on the label.

Since ticket transfers are not operated by Snowcamp, it is strongly recommended to carry them out between trusted individuals.
