# Tickets

You can buy a pack of 3 days (universities + conferences), or 2 days (conferences only).
The tickets can be bought through our partner BilletWeb.
Beware, the number of attendees is limited and we were sold out last year!

## Buy several tickets

Snowcamp doesn't propose to buy several tickets in once time.
It is our policy from the creation of the event.
To buy several tickets, you can only buy each ticket one by one.

## Ticket sharing

The ticket for a single seat obtained during registration allows you to receive a badge on Thursday morning during the welcome session.
Each ticket is personalized and typically cannot be transferred.
However, we tolerate companies sharing badges among their employees over the 2 days.
Thus, for each ticket/seat, it is possible for you to send one person on Thursday and another on Friday.
The badge will be necessary for entry on Friday morning.
The transfer of the badge between the person on Thursday and the one on Friday must be managed on your end.
We do not distribute two badges for a single ticket.
Upon arrival on Friday, the person can affix a label to put their name on the badge.
Please note that the meal preference (regular or vegetarian) will be the one indicated in the Billetweb platform by December 31st.
Beyond this date, we proceed with the order from our caterer (and the printing of badges).
Therefore, ensure that the choice is compatible with the preferences of both individuals sharing the badge.
