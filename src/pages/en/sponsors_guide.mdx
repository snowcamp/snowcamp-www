# Sponsor guide

## Tickets

The sponsorship-related tickets must be claimed by the sponsor through a login URL and a code provided by the Snowcamp organization around mid-November.
Through this link, you can enter the information for each participant: name, first name, email, and meal preference (vegetarian or regular).
You will be able to modify this information until December 31st.
**As conference organizers, we are required by state authorities to know who is attending the event. Therefore, it is necessary that you enter the actual participant information no later than December 31st.**.

<br/>
The ticket retrieval must be completed no later than December 31st before the conference.
After this deadline, the "conference" tickets will no longer be retrievable by the sponsor and will be made available for public purchase.<br/>
There are two types of tickets:

- **Conference Ticket** : Grants access to the conference on Thursday and Friday and allows attendance at talks/schuss during both days.
- **Stand Ticket** : Grants access to the conference on Thursday and Friday but only to the sponsors' hall (containing the booths), the atrium of the WTC.
It does not allow access to presentations (talks/schuss).

### Purchasing multiple tickets
Snowcamp does not offer the option to purchase multiple tickets at once. This is our policy that has been established since the beginning.
To purchase multiple tickets, you must buy them one by one.

### Ticket sharing

The ticket for a single seat obtained during registration allows you to receive a badge on Thursday morning during the welcome session.
Each ticket is personalized and typically cannot be transferred. However, we tolerate companies sharing badges among their employees over the 2 days.
Thus, for each ticket/seat, it is possible for you to send one person on Thursday and another on Friday.<br/>
The badge will be necessary for entry on Friday morning. The transfer of the badge between the person on Thursday and the one on Friday must be managed on your end.
We do not distribute two badges for a single ticket.
Upon arrival on Friday, the person can affix a label to put their name on the badge.<br/>
Please note that the meal preference (regular or vegetarian) will be the one indicated in the Billetweb platform by December 31st.
Beyond this date, we proceed with the order from our caterer (and the printing of badges).<br/>
Therefore, ensure that the choice is compatible with the preferences of both individuals sharing the badge.
