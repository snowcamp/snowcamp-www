  Its purpose is to support local first-time speakers for their first conference through personalized coaching lasting about 2 months.
  from ideation to the final 20-minute session that will take place at a dedicated mini-conference where the talks will be filmed.
  Following a vote, 2 of the participants will be selected to replay their session at the SnowCamp conference.`

    Would you like to have advice and be accompanied?<br><br></em>
    Then Le Tremplin de SnowCamp is for you!<br><br>
    <b>Goal:</b><br>
    To offer free individual support to people wishing to start as a speaker.
    Our volunteer team of experienced coaches will help you during all the stages of preparing your first 20-minute conference,
    up to your speech in front of an audience during the Tremplin evening in Grenoble.<br><br>

    <em>And that's not all!</em> The Tremplin audience will choose 2 talks during the evening, which will be automatically selected for the
    SnowCamp conference program that will take place from ${date}.<br><br>

    <b>Principle of the Tremplin:</b><br>
    Among the proposals received, we will select 6 people to accompany them in defining the idea of their talk,
    structuring, realization and rehearsals until the D-Day of the conference.
    Each participant will benefit from personal coaching to assist him in the realization of his 20-minute talk, on the same categories as Snowcamp.<br><br>

    Whether you already have a well-defined talk idea, or you are simply very motivated by a theme but with a more vague idea,
    do not hesitate to submit your proposal and your motivations: the Tremplin is made for that!<br><br>
    
    <b>Who can participate?</b><br>
    The Tremplin CFP (call for papers) is reserved for first-time speakers who have never given a public conference (meetups or internal conferences do not count).
